                    <p>There are three reasons why I prefer jogging to other sports. One reason is that jogging is a
                        cheap sport. I can practise it anywhere at any time with no need for a ball or any other equipment
                        . Another reason why I prefer jogging is that it is friendly to my heart. I don’t have to exhaust myself
                        or do excessive efforts while jogging. Finally, I prefer this sport because it is safe. It isn’t as risky as
                        other sports like gymnastics, racing or horseback riding. For all these reasons, I consider jogging the best
                        sport of all.
